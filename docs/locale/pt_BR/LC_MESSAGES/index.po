"Python is one of the top-five most popular programming languages in the "

"<https://www.python.org/>`_. Python includes an extensive Standard "
"Library distributed with your installation. The Standard Library has a "
"module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduce programming to "
"kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming language developed"
" by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in `Free "
